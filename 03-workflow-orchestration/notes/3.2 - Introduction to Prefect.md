# 3.2 - Introduction to Prefect

## Key Takeaways

* The video is about Prefect and its various components.
* The video will provide an overview of Prefect terminology and show how to configure a local database.
* The process of setting up the environment and running scripts on the Prefect server will be demonstrated.
* The video will also show how to use retry logic and the workflow UI.
* Flow runs and logs in Prefect will be reviewed towards the end of the video.
* The video is suitable for those interested in learning more about Prefect and its capabilities.

## Prefect

* Why Prefect?
  * Flexible and open source framework to turn standard pipelines into fault-tolerant dataflows

## Terminology
* **Task** - A discrete unit of work in a Prefect workflow
* **Flow** - Container for workflow logic

``` python
from prefect import task, flow

@task
def print_plus_one(obj):
    print(obj + 1)

@flow
def validation_flow(x: int, y: int):
    print_plus_one(x)
    print_plus_one(y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    validation_flow(1, 2)
```

* **Subflow** - Flow called by another flow

``` python
from prefect import flow, task

@task(name="Print Hello")
def print_hello(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@flow(name="Subflow")
def my_subflow(msg):
    print(f"Subflow says: {msg}")

@flow(name="Hellow World")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    message = print_hello(name)
    my_subflow(message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world("sugab")
```

## Setup

* Run compose in `mlflow-server` repo
* Set prefect config in client side (code runner) by `prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api`
* Run python program
