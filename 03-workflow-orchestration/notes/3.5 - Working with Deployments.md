## Key Takeaways

* The video discusses Prefect deployments and S3 data retrieval, including creating and accessing AWS credentials and S3 bucket
* It provides a step-by-step guide on how to create AWS credentials and S3 bucket, and how to create and save an S3 bucket object using Python code
* The video also covers using the S3 bucket block in Prefect, creating and deploying an S3 file with a markdown artifact, customizing parameters for flow runs, and setting up schedules for deployments
* By the end of the video, viewers will have a comprehensive understanding of using AWS credentials and S3 bucket in Prefect.

## Personal Note

What i have done in this section:
* First make RemoteFileSystem minio block in Prefect (UI or via CLI or Python)
* Make deployment in project into Minio, this is for getting dataset via remote
* Add new code to fetch dataset folder from minio
* Deploy all flow (`orchestrate.py` and `orcestrate_minio.py`)
* Run worker pool and run flow
