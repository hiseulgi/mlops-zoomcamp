# 4.1 - Three ways of deploying a model

## Batch mode deployment

* Suitable when predictions can wait for a while (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly)
* Data is pulled from a database, model is applied to data, and predictions are written to another database
* Common use cases include marketing tasks and identifying users at risk of churn


## Web service deployment

* Suitable when predictions are needed immediately (e.g., real-time taxi duration prediction)
* Model is packaged as a web service and deployed to a server
* Client sends requests to the web service, receives predictions, and makes decisions based on predictions


## Streaming deployment

* Suitable when data is constantly being generated and predictions are needed immediately (e.g., content moderation)
* Events are streamed to a stream, consumers process events and make decisions, and decisions are sent to a prediction stream
* Common use cases include content moderation and recommendation systems


## Key differences between batch, web service, and streaming deployment

* Batch mode: Predictions can wait for a while
* Web service: Predictions are needed immediately
* Streaming: Data is constantly being generated and predictions are needed immediately


## Decision of when to use each deployment mode

* Use batch mode when predictions can wait for a while and there is no need for real-time predictions.
* Use web service mode when predictions are needed immediately and there is a clear client-server relationship.
* Use streaming mode when data is constantly being generated and predictions are needed immediately, and there is a need for scalability and flexibility.
