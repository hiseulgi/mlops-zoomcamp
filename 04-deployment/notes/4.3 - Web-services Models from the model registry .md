# 4.3 - Web-services: Getting the models from the model registry (MLflow)

## Key Points

* This video is about combining what was learned in the previous lesson on deploying a model with a web service through Flask with the model registry.
* A Flask application is a web application framework that can be used to deploy machine learning models.
* A model registry is a system for storing and managing machine learning models.
* The flow of this video is as follows:
  * Get the model from the model service using the run id.
  * Remove the dependency on the tracking server and fetch the model directly from S3.
  * Get rid of the dictionary vectorizer by putting it in the pipeline, making the code cleaner.
* The next video will be about batch deployment or streaming.
