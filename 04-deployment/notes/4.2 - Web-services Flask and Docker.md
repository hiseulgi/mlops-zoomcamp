# 4.2 - Web-services: Deploying models with Flask and Docker

## Key Points

* Model deployment is the process of making a machine learning model available to be used by other systems or users.
* There are three main deployment modes: batch, web service, and streaming.
* Batch mode is used when predictions can wait for a while, such as when making marketing decisions or identifying churn risks.
* Web service mode is used when predictions are needed immediately, such as when predicting taxi duration.
* Streaming mode is used when data is constantly being generated and predictions are needed immediately, such as for content moderation or recommendation systems.
* The decision of which deployment mode to use depends on the specific needs of the application.
* Docker is a containerization platform that can be used to package and deploy machine learning models.
* A model registry is a system for storing and managing machine learning models.
* A module registry is a type of model registry that is specifically designed for storing and managing machine learning models that are used in web applications.


## Additional Points

* A Flask application is a web application framework that can be used to deploy machine learning models.
* Gunicorn is a production-grade WSGI server that can be used to run Flask applications.
* Pipenv is a tool for managing Python dependencies.


## Overall

This video provides a good overview of the different deployment modes for machine learning models. It also discusses the use of Docker and module registries for deploying and managing machine learning models.
